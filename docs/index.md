# devops-custom-provider Provider
### Create.Read.Update.Delete (CRUD)
Terraform providers work closely with the idea of CRUD operations. Meaning that the providers
try to calssify api functionality into 4 groups, here are examples related to our api:
- C[reate]
- - Creates new resource; dev, ops, devops
- R[ead]
- - Read in an existing resource
- U[pdate]
- - Update an existing resource, however we can not effect the subresources (engineers) inside it
- D[eletS
- - Deletes an existing resource, however we can not effect those resource's children
